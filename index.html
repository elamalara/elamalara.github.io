<p>Admiration of the beauty that surrounds me gives meaning to my life and action. I have experienced this feeling since I was young and I can gladly say that over the years, it is still blooming in me. As an artist, I try to transfer onto canvas, by means of colors and textures, brush, palette knife, pen or pencil all that fascinates me. Nature is my inspiration; whether it be the changing seasons, still life or portraits.</p>

<p>My works are in numerous private collections in Canada, Austria, France, Germany and Poland. I'm a member of <a href="http://www.societyofcanadianartists.com/content/gallery/gallery_inside.aspx?id=653">Society of Canadian Artists</a></p>
