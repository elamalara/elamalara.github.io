Admiration of the beauty that surrounds me gives meaning to my life and action. I have experienced this feeling since I was young and I can gladly say that over the years, it is still blooming in me. As an artist, I try to transfer onto canvas, by means of colors and textures, brush, palette knife, pen or pencil all that fascinates me. Nature is my inspiration; whether it be the changing seasons, still life or portraits.

My works are in numerous private collections in Canada, Austria, France, Germany and Poland.

I'm a member of [SCA](https://societyofcanadianartists.com/), [WAAH](https://waah.ca/), [Gallery X](https://galleryxscarborough.com/our-board/), [Portage Group](https://portagesemaphore.ca/).
